# Nail_Poker
My first android app, a tool to analyze the expected returns of poker hands. Up to date branch: nailPoker

The goal of this app is to eventually analyze a player's starting hand and return the expected returns in terms of win percentage over
a user defined number of iterations.

Currently the table cards are dealt in standard fashion and the program can detect the "base class" of your best hand given the 7 total
cards. The next step will be determining the exact value (i.e. royal straight > low straight).
